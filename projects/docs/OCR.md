## Scanning considerations that affect the accuracy of OCR include:

1. The recommended best scanning resolution for OCR accuracy is 300 dpi.  Higher resolutions do not necessarily result in better accuracy and can slow down OCR processing time.  Resolutions below 300 dpi may affect the quality and accuracy of OCR results.

2. Brightness settings that are too high or too low may adversely affect OCR accuracy. A medium brightness value of 50% will be suitable in most cases.

3. Straightness of the initial scan can affect OCR quality; crooked lines of text produce poor results.

4. Older and discolored documents must be scanned in RGB mode to capture all the image data, and to maximize OCR accuracy.

5. Image enhancements, such as contrast adjustment and unsharp mask, have NOT been shown to significantly enhance the accuracy of OCR.
